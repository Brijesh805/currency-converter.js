# currency-converter.js
currency-converter.js is a JavaScript file that contains the code for a currency conversion tool. It typically handles the logic for fetching real-time exchange rates from an external API, performing the conversion calculation, and updating the user interface with the result.
Here is a breakdown of its key components:

HTML Elements: The script first gets references to the HTML elements it needs to interact with, such as the input fields for the "from" and "to" currencies, the amount to be converted, and the button to trigger the conversion.

API Integration: It uses the Fetch API to make an asynchronous call to a currency exchange rate API. This is the most crucial part, as it retrieves the current exchange rates. The API key and endpoint URL are usually defined as constants within the script.

Event Listeners: The script sets up event listeners to respond to user actions. The most common listener is for the "click" event on the conversion button. When the button is clicked, the script runs the conversion logic.

Conversion Logic: Inside the event handler, the script takes the amount entered by the user and multiplies it by the exchange rate for the two selected currencies. It also includes error handling for cases where the API call fails or the user provides invalid input.

UI Update: Finally, the script updates the HTML document to display the converted amount. It might also show a loading indicator while the API call is in progress and display a message if an error occurs.
